  This page describes how HRPC deals with errors, including HRPC's built-in error codes. Example code in different languages can be found [here](https://github.com/avinassh/grpc-errors).

### Standard error model

As you'll have seen in our concepts document and examples, when a HRPC call
completes successfully the server returns an `OK` status to the client
(depending on the language the `OK` status may or may not be directly used in
your code). But what happens if the call isn't successful?

If an error occurs, HRPC returns one of its error status codes instead, with an
optional string error message that provides further details about what happened.
Error information is available to HRPC clients in all supported languages.

### Richer error model

The error model described above is the official HRPC error model,
is supported by all HRPC client/server libraries, and is independent of
the HRPC data format (whether protocol buffers or something else). You
may have noticed that it's quite limited and doesn't include the
ability to communicate error details.

If you're using protocol buffers as your data format, however, you may
wish to consider using the the richer error model developed and used
by Google as described
[here](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model). This
model enables servers to return and clients to consume additional
error details expressed as one or more protobuf messages. It further
specifies a [standard set of error message
types](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto)
to cover the most common needs (such as invalid parameters, quota
violations, and stack traces). The protobuf binary encoding of this
extra error information is provided as trailing metadata in the
response.

This richer error model is already supported in the C++, Go, Java,
Python, and Ruby libraries, and at least the grpc-web and Node.js
libraries have open issues requesting it. Other language libraries may
add support in the future if there's demand, so check their github
repos if interested. Note however that the grpc-core library written
in C will not likely ever support it since it is purposely data format
agnostic.

You could use a similar approach (put error details in trailing
response metadata) if you're not using protocol buffers, but you'd
likely need to find or develop library support for accessing this data
in order to make practical use of it in your APIs.

There are important considerations to be aware of when deciding whether to
use such an extended error model, however, including:

  * library implementations of the extended error model may not be consistent
across languages in terms of requirements for and expectations of the error
details payload
  * existing proxies, loggers, and other standard HTTP request
processors don't have visibility into the error details and thus
wouldn't be able to leverage them for monitoring or other purposes
  * additional error detail in the trailers interferes with head-of-line
blocking, and will decrease HTTP/2 header compression efficiency due to
more frequent cache misses
  * larger error detail payloads may run into protocol limits (like
max headers size), effectively losing the original error

### Error status codes

Errors are raised by HRPC under various circumstances, from network failures to
unauthenticated connections, each of which is associated with a particular
status code. The following error status codes are supported in all HRPC
languages.

#### General errors

Case | Status code
-----|-----------
Client application cancelled the request | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;CANCELLED
Deadline expired before server returned status | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
Method not found on server | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNIMPLEMENTED
Server shutting down | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNAVAILABLE
Server threw an exception (or did something other than returning a status code to terminate the RPC) | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNKNOWN
<br>

#### Network failures

Case | Status code
-----|-----------
No data transmitted before deadline expires. Also applies to cases where some data is transmitted and no other failures are detected before the deadline expires | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
Some data transmitted (for example, the request metadata has been written to the TCP connection) before the connection breaks | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNAVAILABLE
<br>

#### Protocol errors

Case | Status code
-----|-----------
Could not decompress but compression algorithm supported | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;INTERNAL
Compression mechanism used by client not supported by the server | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNIMPLEMENTED
Flow-control resource limits reached | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Flow-control protocol violation | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;INTERNAL
Error parsing returned status | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNKNOWN
Unauthenticated: credentials failed to get metadata | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNAUTHENTICATED
Invalid host set in authority metadata | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;UNAUTHENTICATED
Error parsing response protocol buffer | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;INTERNAL
Error parsing request protocol buffer | GRPC&#95;STATUS&#95;INTERNAL
